# Silent Data Fetching Failure in Next.js 15 Server Components

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Next.js 15 server components where complex data fetching logic can lead to silent failures. The server component renders without throwing errors, but data may be missing or incomplete.  The solution involves robust error handling and explicit checks for data availability.

## Bug
The `serverComponentBug.js` file showcases the problematic code.  It attempts to fetch data from multiple APIs, and a failure in one API call can silently break the entire component's data rendering without any obvious error messages.
