The `serverComponentBugSolution.js` file provides a solution.  It incorporates comprehensive error handling using async/await and `try...catch` blocks.  Additionally, explicit checks are added to ensure that each data source has successfully returned data before rendering.  This ensures that missing data is handled gracefully and informs the user if there is a problem.
